//QUESTION 1
int a = 10;
int* p = &a;
*p = 20;
std::cout << a;

What will be the output? -- 20 (p is pointing to a, modified by *p changing value to 20)
Will this run/compile? -- It will run/compile
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- No there are none.(no new keyword)

//QUESTION 2
int* p = nullptr;
*p = 5;

What will be the output? -- Undefined, likely to crash because nullptr does not have a valid address to point too.
Even though *p = 5 is valid, because there is no pointer to an actuall address it will cause errors
Will this run/compile? -- Yes it will run, but possibility for crashing.
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- No

//QUESTION 2.1
int a = 5;
int* p = &a;
int b = *p;
*p = 10;
std::cout << a << " " << b;

What will be the output? -- 10 5 (b is assigned before we change the value of *p)
Will this run/compile? -- Yes
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- No

//QUESTION 3
int* p = new int(5);
delete p;
*p = 10;

What will be the output? -- Will have undefined outcome
Will this run/compile? -- No because we delete p and then try and change it's value with *p, but
the pointer is already deleted.
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- Yes we free the allocated memory with the delete keyword,
and then try and dereference the now deleted pointer.

//QUESTION 4
int a = 10;
float* p = (float*)&a;
std::cout << *p;

What will be the output? -- Undefined behavior
Will this run/compile? -- Yes it will but it will have unknown effects. Casting pointers can lead to undefined behavior.
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- No

//QUESTION 5
int a = 5;
int* p = &a;
p = nullptr;
*p = 10;

What will be the output? -- Undefinined behavior
Will this run/compile? -- Run and Compile but will lead to undefined behavior.
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- Dangling pointer (p no longer points to anything after nullptr.)
