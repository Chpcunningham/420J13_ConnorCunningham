//Question 1
int a = 10;
int* p = &a;
*p = 20;
std::cout << a;

What will be the output? -- 20 (p is pointing to a, modified by *p changing value to 20)
Will this run/compile? -- It will run/compile
Is there a memory leak or dangling pointer? -- No there are none.(no new keyword)

//Question 2
int* p = nullptr;
*p = 5;

What will be the output? -- 5
Will this run/compile? -- Yes
